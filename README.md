# World Weather Analysis
Resources: Python, PANDAS, SciPy, Google API's, Open Weather API
## Overview
In this project, we were tasked with coming up with a program that would generate a roadtrip for a customer. This involved using random latitudes and longitudes and accessing the Open Weather API to get the weather data we needed from the nearest city. We then used the Google Maps API to create interactive maps with pins to the cities that they could go to. Lastly we created a theoretical road trip for them, mine occurring on the west coast of mainland Mexico.
